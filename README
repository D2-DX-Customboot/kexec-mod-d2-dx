This is a fork of the kexec-mod project used by other mobile phones. 
Credit goes mostly to aliasxerog, and also to the Eternity project, I just managed to get 
the module to build and insert properly on the Droid2 (NOT GLOBAL!), meaning
it should also insert just fine on the DroidX.

I need some help getting kexec-tools to compile for the ARM7 Arch, if you'd like to help,
don't be shy!

==========
BUILDING
==========

You *must* use bash, and not zsh or any other shell!

To build, edit envsetup.sh to point to your compiled kernel sources and
Android NDK directory. Then, run the below:

source envsetup.sh
make

You'll then have a nice, fresh kexec_load.ko file as the output.
